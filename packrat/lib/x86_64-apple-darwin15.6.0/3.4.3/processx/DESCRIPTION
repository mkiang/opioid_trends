Description: Portable tools to run system processes in the background.
    It can check if a background process is running; wait on a
    background process to finish; get the exit status of finished
    processes; kill background processes and their children; restart
    processes. It can read the standard output and error of the
    processes, using non-blocking connections. 'processx' can poll a
    process for standard output or error, with a timeout. It can also
    poll several processes at once.

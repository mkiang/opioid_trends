Description: Convenience wrapper that uses the 'rmarkdown' package to
    render small snippets of code to target formats that include both
    code and output. The goal is to encourage the sharing of small,
    reproducible, and runnable examples on code-oriented websites, such
    as <http://stackoverflow.com> and <https://github.com>, or in
    email. 'reprex' also extracts clean, runnable R code from various
    common formats, such as copy/paste from an R session.

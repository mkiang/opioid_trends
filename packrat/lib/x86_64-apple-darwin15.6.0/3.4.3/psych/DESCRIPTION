Description: A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometric
    theory and experimental psychology.  Functions are primarily for
    multivariate analysis and scale construction using factor analysis,
    principal component analysis, cluster analysis and reliability
    analysis, although others provide basic descriptive statistics.
    Item Response Theory is done using factor analysis of tetrachoric
    and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data at
    multiple levels include within and between group statistics,
    including correlations and factor analysis.  Functions for
    simulating and testing particular item and test structures are
    included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for
    structural equation modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams,
    factor analysis and structural equation models are created using
    basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book
    on psychometric theory as well as publications in personality
    research. For more information, see the

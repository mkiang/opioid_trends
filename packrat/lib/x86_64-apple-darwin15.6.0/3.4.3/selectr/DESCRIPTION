Description: Translates a CSS3 selector into an equivalent XPath
    expression. This allows us to use CSS selectors when working with
    the XML package as it can only evaluate XPath expressions. Also
    provided are convenience functions useful for using CSS selectors
    on XML nodes. This package is a port of the Python package
    'cssselect' (<https://pythonhosted.org/cssselect/>).
